It looks like you're encountering a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `requests` module in your Python script. This error indicates that the `requests` module is not installed in your Python environment.

To resolve this, you can install the `requests` module using `pip`. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Open your PowerShell or Command Prompt.
2. Run the following command to install the `requests` module:
   ```powershell
   pip install requests
   ```

Once the installation is complete, you should be able to run your Python script without encountering the `ModuleNotFoundError`.

If you continue to face issues with your PowerShell script, here are a few additional steps to ensure it runs smoothly:

1. **Ensure PowerShell Execution Policy is Set Correctly**:
   - You might need to set the execution policy to allow running scripts. You can do this by running PowerShell as an administrator and executing:
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
     ```

2. **Self-Elevate the PowerShell Script**:
   - Make sure your script includes a self-elevation function to run with administrator privileges. Here’s an updated version of your script with self-elevation:
     ```powershell
     # Windows Software Installer - Full Version
     # Compatible with Boxstarter

     # Self-elevate the script if not running as administrator
     function Elevate-Script {
         if (-not ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal] [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] "Administrator")) {
             Start-Process powershell.exe "-File `"$PSCommandPath`"" -Verb RunAs
             exit
         }
     }
